When tissue or organs are damaged, they could potentially repair themselves with these pluripotent stem cells; this process could reverse or prevent damage to vital organs. This phenomenon already occurs in nature. The zebrafish, a native to South East Asia, can , even as an adult."

Arthritis is a broad term for ailments that affect joints and the tissues that surround them. Most types of arthritis either fall into one of two categories: degenerative arthritis (like osteoarthritis) or inflammatory arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis). These typically occur in areas such as the hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists. Although we have heard that arthritis is just something that we have to deal with as we age, there is good news. Many types of arthritis can be treated by regenerative medicine, allowing for better functionality of the joint and reduced pain symptoms."

Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is prepared from the patient's own blood and contains growth factors that influence wound healing and used in various surgical fields including oral and maxillofacial surgery. When platelets are activated either ex vivo or in vivo, growth factors and proteins were released from platelets' alpha granules. Recent studies proved that PRP could promote regeneration of injured peripheral nerve."
